    <h1>Planned Improvements for ModeMaker</h1>
    <p>ModeMaker was released once it was free of known bugs, but it does have some limitations and features not yet implemeted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add the ability to make the canvas a circle rather than a rectangle</li>
      <li>Move some currently-fixed parameters into a preferences window (e.g., the number of Monte Carlo points used for mode measurements)</li>
      <li>Add new shapes: octagons (c.f., pyroxene), rhombi (c.f., amphiboles)</li>
      <li>Add the ability to create compound shapes (e.g., multiple non-rotated rectangles that would mimic an igneous feldspar)</li>
      <li>Redo the core functionality of the program as a Foundation Tool and put it on the web.    </li>
    </ul>
